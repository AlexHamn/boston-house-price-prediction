# boston-house-price-prediction

Welcome to the Case study on Linear Regression. We will use the Boston house price data to build a regression model.

## Problem Statement

The problem on hand is to predict the housing prices of a town or a suburb based on the features of the locality provided to us. In the process, we need to identify the most important features in the dataset. We need to employ techniques of data preprocessing and build a linear regression model that predicts the prices for us.
